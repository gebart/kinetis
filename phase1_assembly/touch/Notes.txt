Touch Sensitive Interface (TSI)

Principle Of Operation: (Chapter 55, p 1757)

- there are two capacitor-based oscillators on board: reference and external
- the capacitors for both are charged and discharged by a programmable current source
- the capacitor for the reference is on the chip
- the capacitor for the external is the touch pad input and will have a different
  capacitance when touched versus not touched.
- the reference oscillator frequency is much higher than the external frequency
- the TSI counts the number of reference cycles per n external cycles
- a threshold register contains the max and min expected counts for an untouched input
- when the count is outside this threshold a bit in the status register is set, which
  can generate an interrupt, if enabled


Functionality:
- there are 16 TSI inputs, four of which are connected on the Kinetis board
- each input can be individually enabled (PEN) and can have its own threshold (THLD) values.
  This allows for variability between sensors and different size sensors.
- the reference oscillator has the following register-based (SCANC) parameters:
	current (1 to 32 uA, 1 uA resolution), capacitance (0.5 pF to 1.2 pF, 0.1 pF resolution).
	These parameters are used to set the reference oscillator frequency.
- the external oscillator had the following register-based (GENCS, SCANC) parameters:
    current (1 to 32 uA, 1 uA resolution), delta voltage (100 mV to 600 mv, 50 mV resolution),
	cycles per reading (1 to 32 times), prescaler (1 to 128, powers of 2).
	These parameters are used to set the external oscillator frequency and determine
	the number of reference cycles per TSI pad scan.
- TSI can be set to scan one of the 16 inputs in low power mode (1 ms to 500 ms interval)
  This input can then wake the CPU, which will then automatically begin normal scanning of
  all enabled inputs.
- The TSI can run in software-driven mode or fully automatic interrupt-driven mode
- The TSI interrupt vector is 83, which is the 99th IVT entry (83 + 16).
  There is only one interrupt to handle all conditions.
- Interrupts can be enabled for: error (short to VCC, VDD, count=FFFF) and one of end of scan or
  out of range.
- The clock used to run the system in active mode can be one of: Bus Clock, MGIRCLK, OSCERCLK.
  The active mode clock can be scaled 1 to 128, powers of 2
- The low power mode clock can be one of: LPOCLK, VLPOSCCLK

Problems:

- On my board the orange switch is stuck and when an error condition occurs the CPU resets.
  I disabled the orange TSI input for my demo.
- I did not test it but I think that if error interrupts are enabled then the CPU will
  not reset but will instead set the error status bits instead and interrupt the CPU.
