PORT Control module configures the trigger for the external interrupt
    -> Level High/Low
    -> Edge  Rising/Falling
    -> DMA Request Rising/Falling

NVIC itself cannot be configured for a certain trigger type. The NVIC latches
the interrupt signal fed into it. It is up to the peripheral module (in this
case PORT control) to deassert the interrupt signal to the NVIC for edge trigs.

   s4.2.9 Level-sensitive and pulse interrupts

NVIC has register to enable/disable specific peripheral interrupts atomically
