Some Basics
---- ------

DN512   - NOR type
        - 2 X 256KB blocks
        - 2KB sized sectors
        - 0x00000000 - 0x0007ffff
        - Flash is modified via Flash Memory Module (FTFL)

Flash Configuration Field
----- ------------- -----

kinetis_flash_config_field:
    .word 0x01234567    - Backdoor Comparison Key
    .word 0x89abcdef    - Backdoor Comparison Key (continued)
    .word 0xffffffff    - Program Flash Protection
    .byte 0xfe          - Flash Security Byte
    .byte 0xff          - Flash Option Register
    .byte 0xff          - EEPROM Protection (Reserved for DN512)
    .byte 0xff          - Data Flash Protection (Reserved for DN512)

Backdoor Comparison Key | If enabled via Flash Security Register, access to the
                        | FTFL module is only given after the program runs the
                        | Verify Backdoor Access Key command.
                        | The program only gets one attempt to provide the
                        | correct key.

Program Flash Protection | Contents are copied to Program Flash Protection
                         | Registers (FTFL_FPROT0..3) at reset. Flash is
                         | divided in to 32 areas each being represented by a
                         | bit - set means that area not protected, clear means
                         | it is protected.

Flash Security Byte | Contents copied to read only Flash Security Register
                    | (FTFL_FSEC) at reset.
                    | Four functions can be enabled:
                    |   - Backdoor key security
                    |   - Mass erase enable
                    |   - Freescale Failure Analysis Access
                    |   - Flash security

Flash Option Register | Contents copied to read only Flash Option Register
                      | (FTFL_FOPT) at reset.
                      |   - Low power boot
                      |   - EZPORT enable/disable

EEPROM Protection | For devices with FlexNVM
                  | Similar to Program Flash Protection except for EEPROM
                  | region. Region is divided into 8 areas.

Data Flash Protection | For devices with FlexNVM
                      | Similar to Program Flash Protection except for Data
                      | Flash region. Region is divided into 8 areas.
