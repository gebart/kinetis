-Watchdog has windowing mode [s23.3.4]. If Refresh occurs before a certain time
    has elapsed since last reset device resets.

-Refreshing watchdog has same timeout feature as unlocking. Must write
    two half-words within 20 bus clock cycles otherwise device is reset.
    0xA602 followed by 0xB480 [s23.3.3]

-Watchdog can generate ISR before resetting device. ISR is triggered
    then WCT time later (256 bus clock cycles) device is reset
    This would allow an isr to quickly save off register states for debugging
    however I can't seem to get this ISR to ever trip...

-LPO oscillator can be used, clocked at 1Khz. LPO is generated by Power
    Management Controller (PMC) and thus is always powered in all modes
    of operation. [s5.7.1]
