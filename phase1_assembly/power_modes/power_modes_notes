Modules:
NVIC    Nested-vectored interrupt controller
AWIC    Asynchronus wake-up interrupt controller
            detect asynchronus wake-up events in stop modes
            resumes system clocking to allow NVIC to continue processing
LLWU    Low-leakage wakeup unit
            allows the device to wake from low leakage power modes

Special Instructions:
WFI     Wait For Interrupt ARM instruction
            Puts the ARM core into SLEEP or SLEEPDEEP modes
WFE     Wait for Event ARM instruction
            Puts the ARM core into SLEEP or SLEEPDEEP modes conditionally on events
            Events can be interrupts, previous interrupts, previous exceptions (SEV)

ARM Sleep Modes:
    2 Modes:
        SLEEP
            Stops the processor clock
        SLEEPDEEP
            Stop the system clock and switches off the PLL and Flash
    Invoked by the WFI & WFE instructions
        Enter SLEEPDEEP if SLEEPDEEP bit in NVIC SCR
    Waking from either WFI or WFE is conditional wrt:
        The waking interrupt priority level
        Special Registers BASEPRI and PRIMASK
        SEVONPEND bit in the System Control Register

Kinetis Power Modes:

    Normal:
        Run
            Normal operation
            Default out of reset
            Can reduce power using SCGC
        Wait
            Core goes into sleep mode
            Core is clock gated
            Peripherals are clocked
            Normal recovery via interrupt (NVIC)
        Stop
            MCU goes into static state
            All registers are retained
            Peripherals are stopped
            Normal recovery via interrupt (AWIC)

    Very Low Power (VLPx):
        All:
            CPU & Peripheral Clock Max Freq. Restricted 4Mhz ext clock
            Flash Access restricted to 1Mhz
        Run  (VLPR)
        Wait (VLPW)
            Core is put into sleep mode
            Normal recovery via interrupt (NVIC)
        Stop (VLPS)
            MCU is in static state
            Pin interrupts functional
            Normal recovery via interrupt (AWIC)

    Low Leakage Stop (LLS):
        Core put to sleep deep
        Select pin interrupts functional
        Normal recovery via wakeup (LLWU)

    Very Low Leakage Stop (VLLSx):
        All:
            Core put to sleep deep
            I/O States held
            Most peripherals disabled, except:
                LLWU, LPTimer, RTC, CMP, TSI
                These modules are used for wakeup
            Normal recovery via wakeup reset event (LLWU)
        Stop3 (VLLS3):
            SRAM_U & L remain powered
        Stop2 (VLLS2):
            SRAM_U remains powered
            SRAM_L powered off
        Stop1 (VLLS1):
            SRAM_U & L powered off
            Only 32byte register file retained

In General:

    Run Modes
        Core & MCU are running
        Optionally Restrict core & peripheral frequencies
        Can clock gate modules

    Wait Modes
        Core is put to sleep
        Peripherals are still going

    Stop Modes:
        Core is put into deep sleep
        MCU is put into static state
        Most peripherals are disabled
