Freescale Kinetis K60 / ARM Cortex-M4 Project Outline

April 21 2012


The goal of this project is to take a group of talented embedded
software engineers on a soul searching journey to develop a detailed yet
practical understanding of the ARM Cortex-M3/4 using the Freescale Kinetis
family of microcontrollers using the K60 Tower development kit.

A complete getting started guide is available in:

   ./getting_started/getting_started.txt


Also see www.laswick.net/kinetis for various related tools, drivers, docs, etc.


OUTLINE

The project will be broken down into 4 "phases".


    PHASE 1: Assembly Programming

    PHASE 2: Embedded C Programming

    PHASE 3: Real Time Embedded C Programing

        MQX RTOS
        Loadable Modules
        Interactive CLI (target resident command line interface)
        Thread Safe Low Level Drivers

    PHASE 4: Group Project

        I don't know what this is going to be yet, but it's going to be
        awesome...

        Possibly some type of mil-grade stabilized platform :)
