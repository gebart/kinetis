COPYING

Apparently not defining and providing a copyright does not defeat the fact
that a default copyright is globally assumed and implied, which allows others to
read the source code, but they have no legal right to use or modify it.  This
is NOT the intention of this project by any stretch.  The entire purpose of
publishing the our source code is in the hopes that it may be found useful, to
students, teachers, hobbyiests, and professionals.  All source code is intended
to be made available without restriction to be used for learning purposes,
and/or to be used in full or in part in both open and closed source
applications.

The license agreement we've chosen to associate with this project is the
WTF Public License (WTFPL).  Despite its arguably offensive name, this license
clearly conveys the restrictions (or lack thereof) placed upon the use of the
software/source code provided in this project.

Again, appologies to those who may be offended by Sam Hocevar's naming choice
of this license agreement.
