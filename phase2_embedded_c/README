README for Phase 2

1.  All source and header files shall coexist in the same directory.

2.  The file "Makefile" shall not be altered on a per user / per project
    basis as it serves as the default makefile template.

    Users are encouraged to copy Makefile to a project specific .mak file
    (i.e. demoUart.mak) and sym-link it to makefile (lowercase 'm') as GNU
    Make searches for "makefile" before "Makefile".

    .mak files can be added to the repo, but makefile (lowercase 'm') is
    alwasy to be considered an untracked personal file, and not to be added
    to the repo.

    Typically when adding a demonstation module, you would add it, your
    driver, and your correspoding .mak file to the repo at the same time (i.e.
    uart.c, demoUart.c demoUart.mak).

3.  One of the goals of Phase 2 is a common build system and driver library.
    Therefore the provided Makefile, startcode, and linkerscript shall
    serve be used for all builds.

4.  All drivers should provide generic and full featured APIs with the goal of
    ease of use in mind.

    Each driver file should include as much comments as needed to help the
    reader better understand what's going on.  Blog in the source file
    instead of creating a seperate notes file.

    At the top of each driver file in the file header comment block, the
    main/global API(s) should be clearly described.

5.  The focus of each presentation will be on the details, configuration, use,
    and intricacies of the presentation topic - not on the source code.
