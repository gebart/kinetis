Please follow the recommended git workflow below.


1. Clone our git repository, if you haven't already.

    git clone git@github.com:laswick/kinetis.git kinetis.git


2. Create a working branch to develop in.

    git checkout -b working


3. Make your changes, experiment, and commit often.

    git commit -a


4. When you're ready to push your changes to our server, first ensure
   your master branch is up to date.

    git checkout master
    git pull


5. Once your master branch is up to date, merge in your changes.

    git merge --squash working


6. Commit your changes, and BE SURE TO EDIT the commit log so it's meaningful.

    git commit


7. Push your changes to the server.

    git push


8. Continue your development from a clean slate.

    git branch -D working
    git checkout -b working


9. Rinse and Repeat!
